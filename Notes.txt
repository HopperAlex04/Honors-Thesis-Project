player.play

    compute all possible moves

    make a choice
        agent selects from computed moves
        human player constructs a move through prompting (terminal) or buttons (gui)

    compare choice to values in computed moves:
        a move is of the form [ActionType, Card, targets[]]
        targets is empty if no targets such as when scoring or if targets are random

    Note:Need to figure out how to handle response windows.
