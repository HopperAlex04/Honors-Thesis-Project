How to handle revealed cards
    A revealed card remains revealed until it moves to a new zone
    Most of the time this is empty

Effect Shown: The cards revealed by 7

2s: When an action is taken, we begin storing the information required for multiple transitions as follows
    p1 uses one-off (Store the initial state and action to be composed into a transition later)
    p2 decides to counter (Store the state after the one-off enters the stack and the decsion to use the 2 or not)
    p1 decides to counter (Store the state after the 2 enters the stack and the decsion to use 2 or not)
    *repeat until we run out of 2s or someone decides not to act*

    Resolve backwards (we stored the actual moves until resolution which get popped off in step)

    Note: For one offs add another parameter for resolution, if true, act normal, if not return

    after resolution we reach a final state (i.e. the opponents initial state)
    p1 will store (initial_state, action, next_state, reward) for their actual action as normal
    p2 will store (stack1_state, decsion, end_turn_state, reward) Here we will evaluate if this decison won or lost them the game that turn for reward
    p1 will also store (stack2_state, decsion, next_state, reward) so they learn how countering affects the opponents next turn


Multi-Stage Decsions (4s, 7s)
    When resolved, the effect-shown zone will change accordingly and then another


Implementation help: Create lists for score card indicies and royal indicies

Add flags for the eights and keep track of number of queens.
