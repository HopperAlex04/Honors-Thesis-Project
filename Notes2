7: Reveal top 2, play one
3:Grab a card from scrap
Ask about how best it would be to handle temporary knowledge

4:This is a two stage decision (choose to use, then pick target from hand), get advice on how to proceed

The easy way would be to just play with hands revealed

Proposed 2 implementation:
    Basically just get another action while giving the agent the option of using the two or doing nothing


Expected results if the network is learning the right things:
(<bound method CuttleEnvironment.aceAction of <GameEnvironment.CuttleEnvironment object at 0x701e8f3fb740>>, [0])
59
(<bound method CuttleEnvironment.aceAction of <GameEnvironment.CuttleEnvironment object at 0x701e8f3fb740>>, [13])
61
(<bound method CuttleEnvironment.aceAction of <GameEnvironment.CuttleEnvironment object at 0x701e8f3fb740>>, [26])
66
(<bound method CuttleEnvironment.aceAction of <GameEnvironment.CuttleEnvironment object at 0x701e8f3fb740>>, [39])
54
(<bound method CuttleEnvironment.fiveAction of <GameEnvironment.CuttleEnvironment object at 0x701e8f3fb740>>, [4])
59
(<bound method CuttleEnvironment.fiveAction of <GameEnvironment.CuttleEnvironment object at 0x701e8f3fb740>>, [17])
59
(<bound method CuttleEnvironment.fiveAction of <GameEnvironment.CuttleEnvironment object at 0x701e8f3fb740>>, [30])
51
(<bound method CuttleEnvironment.fiveAction of <GameEnvironment.CuttleEnvironment object at 0x701e8f3fb740>>, [43])
73

These two actions are really strong so I would hope the network figured it out. May need to log by movetype instead of the full move to get a better picture
Scoring actions were also significantly more present than scuttling

We are starting to hit the point that we need more trials to learn, expected, we are fast enough to do it, may need bigger buffer
