7: Reveal top 2, play one
3:Grab a card from scrap
Ask about how best it would be to handle temporary knowledge

4:This is a two stage decision (choose to use, then pick target from hand), get advice on how to proceed

The easy way would be to just play with hands revealed

Proposed 2 implementation:
    Basically just get another action while giving the agent the option of using the two or doing nothing
