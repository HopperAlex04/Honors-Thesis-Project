  "description": "Architecture comparison experiment using learned card embeddings for preprocessing. Compares three architectures (linear, large_hidden, game_based) all using the same embedding-based input representation. Previous experiments showed embeddings achieve 62% win rate vs 18% for boolean inputs, making this a fair comparison of architectures with a representation that actually learns.",
